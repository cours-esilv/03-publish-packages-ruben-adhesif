For step 4 and 5, I recreat a repos on my own to get the publish package

Once done I get this command lines :
``` bash
docker pull ghcr.io/ruben-adhesif/publish-packages/game:sha-6cf0793
docker run -dp 8080:80 --rm b12d19c644e8
```

My own repos is here but I would like to be graded on the school repos
